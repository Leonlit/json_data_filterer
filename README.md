# Json_data_filterer
A simple program that generate a new JSON file with the data that's filtered during data filtering of a JSON file. You can read more on how I wrote this script in [this blog post](https://devtavern.blogspot.com/2020/08/how-did-i-created-json-file-data.html).

## setting up

To setup the project, first download the project by downloading the repo zip file. If you have git installed on your computer (which you most probably have), clone the project using 

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Leonlit/json_data_filterer.git
```

After that, open up your terminal and run :
```
npm install
```

This will download the necessary dependencies for the project.


## Running the project

To run the project, first make sure your terminal is in the correct directory. Then, run 
```
node ./main.js
```
To start the program.

Everything after this is all based on the JSON file location that you've provided to the program.
